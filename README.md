# GPX_Toolbox
An ESRI Python Toolbox created to convert .gpx files to a point and line shapefile.  Users can set limits for max speed of travel, max distance between points, and the minimum number of points to form a line.  These options allow omission of bad locations and, for example, data which was collected a highway speeds rather than off road.

This tool takes a folder as input and will process all gpx files in that folder.
