# GPX_Toolbox
An ESRI Python Toolbox created to convert .gpx location files exported from consumer GPS units to a point and line shapefile.  Users can set limits for max speed of travel, max distance between points, and the minimum number of points to form a line.  These options allow omission of bad locations and, for example, data which was collected a highway speeds rather than off road.
